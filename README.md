Before you start:

Windows:
gem install rails

Linux:
sudo gem install rails


To Do:

1. ~~Adventure Delete button raises error: SQLite3::ConstraintException: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed: DELETE FROM~~

2. Scene Delete Button Error similar to above

3. Decision Delete button error, not similar to above but equally annoying

4. **** Player: Play Scenes add in route and button from startadventure page. Make sure it plays the first scene (IDk how to do that). Sort of the next step. We need to get it to actually play.

5. Fix redirect_to for pretty much everything, I can't figure it out for the life of me. They all go to weird places. (plz let me know whoever fixes this, I'm lost and would love to be taught how it works)

6. Decisions Edit button doesn't exist.

7. Figure out other issues and add them in.

8. Fix Adventure_ID issue, where we add scenes to wrong adventure.

9.
